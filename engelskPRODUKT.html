                    <h1>The Solution</h1>
                    <p>
                        By making Clibano S a more user-friendly combi oven than any other on the marked, it can help solve problems within the health and care sector. We have through studies seen what issues arise amongst elders when they cook and identified what weaknesses they have. Reduced functional ability is a part of getting old and that is why we have created a combi oven that facilitates usage for the elders.

                    <p>
                        A simple user interface will give elders the ability and freedom to cook their own meals, at their leisure. Many elders have often had to wait for their helpers to come prepare the food due to the ovens often being too advanced. The helpers will also have more time to spare if the elders are capable of preparing their own meals. The quality of life for the elder, who can now cook for themselves, is likely to increase due to this. When the issue of elders not being able to cook for themselves is resolved, it will make it possible for this person to live at home for a longer period of time. This can help relieve the load of the already overloaded nursing homes.

                        Clibano S comes with voice control and QR / barcode scanner. Using new technology, the scanner will send the required information to the oven and prepare the meal in the best possible way. The function is designed to make cooking easier for the benefit of the elderly. Clibano S has the option of manually adjusting heat and time, if desired. The oven can be controlled by voice and can respond with voice, as well as having internet connection. The voice function is made to help elderly with impaired vision. The door has an integrated display showing the necessary information about the meal. The large screen serves as the oven display and is enlarged to satisfy older people's use. The door shows for example, temperature, time and program. The technology that Clibano S offers helps you get the information you want, either visually or by audio.
