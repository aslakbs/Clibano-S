                    Numbers from Statistics Norway show an increase in life expectancy and population growth in the future. This means that the amount of elderly will increase, which also increases the need for resources in the health and care sector. We therefore become more dependent on the elders ability to live at home for as long as possible, to avoid exceeding the capacity of nursing homes or available nurses. Therefore, it becomes important to find a solution that can make it easier for the elderly to be independent at home. One reason that elderly gets pushed out of their home and into nursing homes, is because the cooking is too demanding. Preparing food in micro often becomes a solution, but here's a new problem.

                    Observations and interviews indicate elderly repeatedly struggle to learn new technology. Due to this issue the elderly are prone to encounter trouble preparing their food in the combination oven found in today's market. Standard ovens usually have too many buttons and features that makes it too advanced. The solution is that the homenurses must help the elderly to turn the oven on when they are visiting and try to teach the elderly how to use the oven. The user rarely learns anything from this and often ends up having to wait until the nurse comes. It is therefore important that one looks for a solution that can make it easier and more user-friendly for the elderly to prepare their own food. This is where our smart combination oven, Clibano S, comes into the picture.
